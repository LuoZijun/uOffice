Welcome to Python-OOXML's documentation!
========================================

Python-OOXML is a Python library for parsing Office Open XML files. At the moment it only supports HTML as output format. Strong emphasis is put on easy customization of the output.
The library comes with an importer which is capable of splitting a document into separate chapters. It works both with documents which use Word styles, and documents where they are not used.
